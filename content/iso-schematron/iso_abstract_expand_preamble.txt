     OVERVIEW - iso_abstract_expand.xsl
     
	    This is a preprocessor for ISO Schematron, which implements abstract patterns. 
	    It also 
	       	* extracts a particular schema using an ID, where there are multiple 
             schemas, such as when they are embedded in the same NVDL script 
           * allows parameter substitution inside @context, @test, @select, @path
	    	   * experimentally, allows parameter recognition and substitution inside
             text (NOTE: to be removed, for compataibility with other implementations,   
             please do not use this) 
		
		This should be used after iso-dsdl-include.xsl and before the skeleton or
		meta-stylesheet (e.g. iso-svrl.xsl) . It only requires XSLT 1.
		 
		Each kind of inclusion can be turned off (or on) on the command line.
